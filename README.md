## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

-   summary table of a linear model: ![deliverable_1\_summary](deliv_1_lm.png)

1. A linear regression analysis was performed on 50 prototype MechaCars to predict MPG based on five other variables. Based on the above summary table, it can be determined that two variables, vehicle length and ground clearance, have a statistically significant, non-random impact on the fuel efficiency of the MechaCar.

2. The slopes of each regression are listed under the "estimate" column. Each coefficient, when converted from scientific notation are all non-zero number, indicating that the slope is considered to be not zero. 

The converted coefficients are: 
vehicle length: 6.267
vehicle weight: .001
spoiler angle: .069
ground clearance: 3.546
AWD: -3.411

3. This linear model does effectively predict the mpg of the MechaCar. According to the summary table above, the multiple R-Squared value is 0.71, meaning that 71% of variability of the MechaCar's mpg can be explained using this linear model. 0.71 is considered to be a strong, positive correlation.
